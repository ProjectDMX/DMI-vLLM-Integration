# vLLM model coverage roadmap

This document defines the model backlog for the vLLM 0.27.1 port. It is a
versioned discovery snapshot, not a support claim.

## Snapshot and scope

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Snapshot time | 2026-08-13 03:32 UTC |
| Current upstream release | [`v0.27.1`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/tag/v0.27.1) |
| Target upstream commit | `6e448d0ea9bf3d88d898b65449ca6dc2aec170ac` |
| Current DMI supported port | DMI branch `vllm-0.27-model-expansion` / standalone integration branch `vllm-0.27-model-expansion` / official vLLM `0.27.1` |
| Registry source | [`v0.27.1` model registry](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.27.1/vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py) |
| Runtime registry evidence | [`vllm-0.27.1-runtime-registry.json`](vllm-0.27.1-runtime-registry.json), official wheel, 41/41 lazy classes resolved |
| Upstream test exemplars | [`v0.27.1` test registry](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.27.1/tests/models/registry.py) |
| Popularity/config source | timestamped [Hugging Face model API](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/api) lookups of official publisher checkpoints |

"Mainstream" here means a curated general-purpose generation family from an
official publisher that has meaningful ecosystem adoption or represents a major
current open-model release. Download counts are only a moving prioritization
signal. Community quantizations, duplicate sizes, pure embedding/reward models,
audio-only models, and draft-only architectures are excluded. "Open model" is
not a license conclusion; checkpoint access and deployment terms must be checked
per family.

The inventory resolves each checkpoint's declared architecture against the
exact target registry and separately inspects DMI's static remap.
The source catalog was also replayed through the official `vllm==0.27.1` wheel
in a CPU-only process with Python 3.12.8 and PyTorch 2.13.0+cu130. The
repository verifier resolved all 41 lazy classes, including Kimi-K3 and
DeepSeek-V4 under `vllm.models.*`. This is stronger import evidence than parsing
the registry source, but remains upstream-static evidence rather than DMI
runtime support. Across the 41 representative checkpoints below:

- all 41 resolve in vLLM 0.27.1;
- 16 architectures have a DMI model remap on the current stacked expansion
  branch;
- 25 are unmapped by DMI;
- registry presence is upstream static evidence, not DMI runtime support.

Between vLLM 0.25.1 and 0.27.1, the combined text/multimodal registry adds eight
architectures, removes eight, and remaps two. In particular, Kimi-K3 first
appears in the newer registry, Qwen3.5 gains text-only architecture entries, and
OLMo3 no longer resolves through the OLMo2 implementation.

## Phase 0: validate and re-port existing DMI variants

These models gate all expansion work. The 0.25.1 status comes from
[`vllm-0.25.1-compatibility-audit.md`](vllm-0.25.1-compatibility-audit.md). Every
row must be re-audited after the worker/runner port to 0.27.1.

| Representative checkpoint | architecture | vLLM 0.27.1 implementation | DMI 0.25.1 evidence | DMI 0.27.1 status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openai-community/gpt2` | `GPT2LMHeadModel` | `gpt2:GPT2LMHeadModel` | supported, eager+graph+storage | supported; TP1 public and TP1/TP2 storage value cells passed the final matrix |
| `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` | `Qwen2ForCausalLM` | `qwen2:Qwen2ForCausalLM` | supported, eager+graph | supported; TP1 public eager+graph passed the final matrix |
| `Qwen/Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B-Chat` | `Qwen2MoeForCausalLM` | `qwen2_moe:Qwen2MoeForCausalLM` | supported, TP2 eager+graph+storage | supported; TP2 public/storage value cells passed; EP remains excluded |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` | `Qwen3ForCausalLM` | `qwen3:Qwen3ForCausalLM` | supported via 0.6B checkpoint, eager+graph+storage | supported; TP1 public and TP1/TP2 storage value cells passed the final matrix |
| `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` | `LlamaForCausalLM` | `llama:LlamaForCausalLM` | supported via 3.1-8B checkpoint, TP2 eager+graph+storage | supported; Llama-3.1-8B TP2 public/storage value cells passed the final matrix |

## Phase 1: bounded single-GPU families

Start with small dense and hybrid checkpoints that fit a 24 GiB accelerator.
This phase deliberately includes different implementation contracts instead of
adding only Llama-like aliases.

| Order | Representative checkpoint | downloads snapshot | architecture | vLLM 0.27.1 implementation | contract class |
| ---: | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `google/gemma-3-1b-it` | 5,088,478 | `Gemma3ForCausalLM` | `gemma3:Gemma3ForCausalLM` | dense, Gemma norm/attention |
| 2 | `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` | 1,021,348 | `Phi3ForCausalLM` | `phi3:Phi3ForCausalLM` | Llama subclass with distinct packing |
| 3 | `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` | 1,169,540 | `MistralForCausalLM` | `mistral:MistralForCausalLM` | Llama-derived dense, sliding/scale branches |
| 4 | `tiiuae/Falcon-H1-0.5B-Instruct` | 23,911 | `FalconH1ForCausalLM` | `falcon_h1:FalconH1ForCausalLM` | attention/Mamba hybrid |
| 5 | `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct` | 510,295 | `Lfm2ForCausalLM` | `lfm2:Lfm2ForCausalLM` | attention/short-convolution hybrid |
| 6 | `ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-3B` | 26,935 | `JambaForCausalLM` | `jamba:JambaForCausalLM` | dense attention/Mamba hybrid; MoE configs excluded |
| 7 | `ibm-granite/granite-4.1-8b` | 4,155,476 | `GraniteForCausalLM` | `granite:GraniteForCausalLM` | dense with four model-specific scalar operations; runtime-qualified on the 3B sibling |
| 8 | `allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Instruct` | 425,421 | `Olmo3ForCausalLM` | `olmo3:Olmo3ForCausalLM` | dense; implementation changed since 0.25.1 |
| 9 | `swiss-ai/Apertus-8B-Instruct-2509` | 472,853 | `ApertusForCausalLM` | `apertus:ApertusForCausalLM` | dense with model-specific attention/norm |
| 10 | `baidu/ERNIE-4.5-0.3B-PT` | 22,897 | `Ernie4_5ForCausalLM` | `ernie45:Ernie4_5ForCausalLM` | modified Llama subclass |
| 11 | `openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B` | 48,765 | `MiniCPMForCausalLM` | `minicpm:MiniCPMForCausalLM` | dense, remote-code/version constraints |

Current expansion status: Gemma 3 is `experimental` for the TP1 V1 offline
eager/default-graph cells at historical source commit `b71a55ae4227`. The
[`Gemma 3 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-gemma3-audit.md) records strict public parity,
complete hook storage, and byte-identical eager/graph transport on a six-layer
tiny fixture. The official `google/gemma-3-1b-it` checkpoint was gated for the
available account, so the real-checkpoint completion gate remains open and the
row is not yet `supported`.

Phi-3 is `supported` for the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline eager/default-graph
cell at historical source commit `b4965771d8a4`. The
[`Phi-3 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-phi3-audit.md) records strict public tests on the
official `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` checkpoint plus byte-identical
eager/graph full-hook transport on a tiny fixture. TP>1, PP, quantization,
serving, speculative, and non-text task variants remain excluded.

Mistral is `supported` for the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline eager/default-graph
cell at historical source commit `8c89ec33bbc5`. The
[`Mistral audit`](vllm-0.27.1-mistral-audit.md) records strict public parity on
the official `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` checkpoint and byte-identical
eager/graph full-hook transport on a qualified small fixture. Configurations
that enable Llama-4 attention scaling or adaptive conditional RMS normalization,
alternate loaders, TP>1, quantization, serving, speculative, and non-text
variants remain excluded.

Falcon-H1 is `supported` for the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline
eager/default-graph cell at historical source commit `e69be3978552`. The
[`Falcon-H1 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-falcon-h1-audit.md) records public validation on
the official 0.5B checkpoint, byte-identical eager/graph full-hook transport on
the official Tiny checkpoint, and the bounded SSM branch capability manifest.
Internal Mamba state, TP>1, prefix caching, quantization, serving, speculative,
and non-text variants remain excluded.

LFM2 is `supported` for the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline eager/default-graph
cell at historical source commit `229014dd9692`. The
[`LFM2 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-lfm2-audit.md) records strict public parity on the
official `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct` checkpoint and byte-identical
eager/graph full-hook transport on a qualified two-layer hybrid fixture. The
manifest distinguishes ten production convolution layers from six attention
layers. Internal convolution/cache state, LFM2-MoE/VL, TP>1, prefix caching,
quantization, serving, and speculative modes remain excluded.

Jamba is `supported` only for the dense official `ai21labs/AI21-Jamba2-3B`
configuration in the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline eager/default-graph cell at
integration commit `b4556982f63d`. The
[`Jamba audit`](vllm-0.27.1-jamba-audit.md) records public API parity and
byte-identical eager/graph storage on the same production checkpoint. Its
truthful 263-family manifest distinguishes 26 Mamba1 layers from attention
layers 7 and 21. The loader fails closed if any layer has more than one expert;
Jamba-MoE, other Jamba schedules, internal recurrent/cache state, TP>1, prefix
caching, quantization, serving, and speculative modes remain excluded.

Granite is `supported` for the official
`ibm-granite/granite-4.1-3b` checkpoint in the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline
eager/default-graph cell at historical source commit `dca631b19ec7`. The
[`Granite audit`](vllm-0.27.1-granite-audit.md) records public API parity and
byte-identical eager/graph storage on that same production checkpoint. Its
485-family manifest preserves Granite's attention, embedding, residual, and
logits scaling and adds the exact post-activation MLP boundary. Granite 4.1 8B
and 30B share the statically audited dense path but remain runtime-unqualified;
Granite MoE/hybrid/multimodal models, TP>1, prefix caching, quantization,
serving, and speculative modes remain excluded.

OLMo 3 is `supported` for the official `allenai/Olmo-3-7B-Instruct`
checkpoint in the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline eager/default-graph cell at
integration commit `9f6a5c762bc5`. The
[`OLMo 3 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-olmo3-audit.md) records public API parity and
byte-identical eager/graph storage on that same production checkpoint. Its
389-family manifest follows OLMo 3's post-norm residual order and observes Q/K
after Q/K normalization but before the layer-type-specific RoPE. Available tiny
fixtures do not independently cover the production sliding/full schedule plus
both default and YaRN RoPE branches, so they are not used to generalize the
runtime verdict. Other checkpoints, TP>1, prefix caching, quantization, serving,
speculative, and other OLMo-family architectures remain excluded.

Apertus is `supported` for the official
`swiss-ai/Apertus-8B-Instruct-2509` checkpoint in the bounded TP1 BF16 V1
offline eager/default-graph cell at historical source commit `3d5e5fb6b87f`. The
[`Apertus audit`](vllm-0.27.1-apertus-audit.md) records strict public API parity
and byte-identical eager/graph storage on that same production checkpoint. Its
389-family manifest follows fused pre-norm residual arithmetic, observes Q/K
after per-head normalization and before RoPE, and exposes the xIELU
post-activation boundary. The verdict covers vLLM's Python xIELU fallback;
Apertus v1.1/70B and other config branches, the optional fused xIELU extension,
TP>1, prefix caching, quantization, serving, and speculative modes remain
excluded.

ERNIE 4.5 dense is `supported` for the official
`baidu/ERNIE-4.5-0.3B-PT` checkpoint in the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline
eager/default-graph cell at historical source commit `6f2cf03f68e4`. The
[`ERNIE 4.5 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-ernie45-audit.md) records strict public API
parity and byte-identical eager/graph storage on that same production
checkpoint. Its 203-family manifest follows the inherited dense Llama block,
while the monitored and compare variants explicitly replay ERNIE's non-NeoX
rotary and bias-free output-projection post-init changes. Other ERNIE sizes,
ERNIE MoE/VL, alternate configuration branches, TP>1, prefix caching,
quantization, serving, and speculative modes remain excluded.

MiniCPM 4.1 dense is `supported` for the official
`openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B` checkpoint in the bounded TP1 BF16 V1 offline
eager/default-graph cell at historical source commit `db9e7cfccc0b`. The
[`MiniCPM 4.1 audit`](vllm-0.27.1-minicpm4-audit.md) records strict public API
parity and byte-identical eager/graph storage on that same production
checkpoint. Its 389-family manifest preserves scaled embeddings, both
depth-scaled residual branches, LongRoPE placement, and final width scaling.
Pinned remote repository code is used only to parse the configuration under
Transformers 5.15.0; vLLM's native implementation executes the model. Earlier
MiniCPM families, MoE/FatReLU/sparse/multimodal branches, TP>1, prefix caching,
quantization, serving, speculative modes, and remote Hugging Face model
execution remain excluded.

For each row, use an upstream tiny/random fixture for fast focused tests when
available, then require one real-checkpoint baseline/monitored run before moving
beyond `static-only`.

## Phase 2: MoE, MLA, large, and quantization-dependent text models

These need two or three local GPUs, a quantized production checkpoint, an
upstream tiny fixture, or a larger external test cell. They must not inherit a
dense-model verdict.

| Representative checkpoint | downloads snapshot | architecture | vLLM 0.27.1 implementation | primary new contract |

| `LiquidAI/LFM2.5-8B-A1B` | 169,971 | `Lfm2MoeForCausalLM` | `lfm2_moe:Lfm2MoeForCausalLM` | hybrid short-convolution plus MoE |
| `tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct` | 41,334 | `HunYuanMoEV1ForCausalLM` | `hunyuan_v1:HunYuanMoEV1ForCausalLM` | MoE, remote-code checkpoint |
| `baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-PT` | 40,021 | `Ernie4_5_MoeForCausalLM` | `ernie45_moe:Ernie4_5_MoeForCausalLM` | MoE counterpart to dense ERNIE |
| `XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2-Flash` | 89,530 | `MiMoV2FlashForCausalLM` | `mimo_v2:MiMoV2FlashForCausalLM` | MoE and model-specific attention |
| `ByteDance-Seed/Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct` | 41,334 | `SeedOssForCausalLM` | `seed_oss:SeedOssForCausalLM` | large dense/parallel ownership |

| `LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-4.5-33B` | 174,939 | `Exaone4_5_ForConditionalGeneration` | `exaone4_5:Exaone4_5_ForConditionalGeneration` | conditional-generation text model |

## Phase 3: multimodal and external-plugin implementations

Text-backbone testing is insufficient for these rows. Their support cells must
also cover processor inputs, multimodal batching, public outputs, graph behavior,
and modality-specific lifecycle paths. Implementations under `vllm.models.*`
also require exact plugin package and lazy-resolution evidence.

| Representative checkpoint | downloads snapshot | architecture | vLLM 0.27.1 implementation | reason for later phase |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` | 6,577,318 | `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` | `qwen3_5:Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` | current official checkpoint is conditional/multimodal |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` | 4,538,226 | `Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration` | `qwen3_vl:Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration` | vision-language API |

| `meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct` | 460,443 | `Llama4ForConditionalGeneration` | `mllama4:Llama4ForConditionalGeneration` | multimodal/MoE family |
| Ministral 3 3B Instruct (2512) | 322,387 | Mistral 3 conditional generation | `mistral3` module | multimodal conditional wrapper |
| `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` | 855,995 | `KimiK25ForConditionalGeneration` | `kimi_k25:KimiK25ForConditionalGeneration` | multimodal and very large |
| `moonshotai/Kimi-K3` | 1,565,484 | `KimiK3ForConditionalGeneration` | `vllm.models.kimi_k3:KimiK3ForConditionalGeneration` | added after 0.25.1; external plugin, multimodal |
| `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` | 2,283,943 | `DeepseekV4ForCausalLM` | `vllm.models.deepseek_v4:DeepseekV4ForCausalLM` | external plugin and very large |

## Per-model completion gate

A row moves to `supported` only after all applicable evidence exists:

1. M01-M14 and R01-R07 agent audit against the exact target implementation;
2. lazy import and official-wheel registry resolution;
3. constructor, forward, loader, hook-inventory, shape, and placement regressions;
4. separate-process baseline/monitored public-output parity on a tiny fixture and
   a real checkpoint;
5. eager and every claimed CUDA-graph mode;
6. transport and ClickHouse value/exact-once/tail/isolation checks;
7. every claimed TP/PP/EP topology, including rank ownership;
8. bounded capacity, failure, cancellation, and repeated-stop paths;
9. multimodal/serve/quant/speculative gates when those dimensions are claimed.

`unmapped`, `static-only`, `experimental`, and `untested` rows keep the roadmap
open. A registry gap or infeasible/inaccessible checkpoint must be recorded as an
explicit `unsupported` decision rather than silently removed.

## GPU scheduling rule

The two-GPU regression starts only when at least two physical GPUs satisfy all
of the following for three consecutive samples:

- no compute process is attached;
- less than 1 GiB device memory is in use;
- utilization remains below 10 percent.

Unrelated processes are never terminated. Once two cards qualify, pin the exact
indices with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`/`E2E_GPUS`, run the 0.27.1 focused and public
black-box gates, then run the scoped ClickHouse TP=1/TP=2 transport matrix. Use a
unique capture ID and delete only rows belonging to that capture.
